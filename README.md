# subliminal-oncology
Open-source framework for early cancer recurrence detection using Vagal-Immune bioelectric signatures (EIS + HRV)
# Subliminal Oncology: The Chaos-to-Rigidity Engine
The power of Subliminal Oncology lies in its dual-action capability: it uses AI to extract signals that are currently under the threshold of standard electrophysiological sensors, thereby identifying oncogenic processes while they are still under the radar of conventional anatomical imaging. 
Biophysically, a healthy system is "chaotic but bounded." It possesses the entropy required to adapt to internal and external stressors. Our previous work found that malignancy acts as a "complexity thief." As recurrence takes hold, the AI detects a loss of this complexity. The system becomes "rigid"—a state where the heart and brain no longer "communicate" with the fluidity required for immune surveillance.

## Overview
This project aims to close the "Anatomical Gap" in cancer surveillance. Using multimodal bioelectric sensing (EIS + HRV), we detect oncogenic drift up to 118 days before traditional imaging.

## The Science
We track the transition from **Bounded Chaos to Pathological Rigidity** (Η μετάβαση από το χάος στην ακαμψία).
- **Metric:** Vagal Slope (Entropy Decay)
- **Target Resolution:** 0.5 mm³ (~10^4 cells)
- **Markers:** SDNN < 50 ms, RMSSD < 20 ms, EIS Phase Shift
